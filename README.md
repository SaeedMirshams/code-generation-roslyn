## Code Generation with Roslyn: a Skeleton Class from UML

We have already seen some examples of transformation and analysis of C# code with Roslyn. Now we are going to see how to create a more complex example of code generation with Roslyn and parsing with Sprache. We are going to create a skeleton class from a PlantUML file.

**You can read a tutorial on this repository at [Code Generation with Roslyn: a Skeleton Class from UML ](https://tomassetti.me/code-generation-with-roslyn-a-skeleton-class-from-uml)**
